# 🔍 Day 13 - Intent Recognition (Hinglish) | AI Learning Journey

This project notebook focuses on **Intent Recognition** in **Hinglish (Hindi-English mixed language)** text. It forms part of a larger AI/ML learning journey—specifically Day 13—where we explore natural language processing techniques to classify the user’s intent in conversational inputs.

## 🎯 Objective

The main goal of this notebook is to:

- Understand and build a pipeline for **intent classification**.
- Handle **Hinglish** data (a mix of Hindi and English words).
- Train a deep learning model using **TensorFlow/Keras** to classify intents.
- Apply **tokenization**, **padding**, and **label encoding** techniques.
- Deploy and evaluate the model.

---

## 📚 Topics Covered

- Text preprocessing (stopword removal, cleaning)
- Tokenization & Sequencing using TensorFlow
- One-hot encoding of intents
- Model architecture design using Keras
- Training, validation & accuracy analysis
- Saving and using the trained model

## 📝 Dataset

The dataset used contains Hinglish utterances and corresponding intents, structured like:

```csv
text,intent
"main youtube kholna chahta hoon",open_youtube
"camera open karo",open_camera
"time kya hua hai",get_time
...
```

> 📌 **Note:** The dataset is either loaded from a local `CSV` file or embedded within the notebook itself.
